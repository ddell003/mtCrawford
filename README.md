## About
I made this website in College without using bootstrap. I made this website for the Town of Mt Crawford. This project taught me about responsive websites and media queries to make a screen adjust to the device it is viewed on. I have started adding bootstrap elements into it. I will probably make a new repository for the pure bootstrap project. Since making this project I have learned how bootstrap works under the hood and all the things re take for granted like columns rows, tabs and other components they have built out.
